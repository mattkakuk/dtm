**Online marketing** includes search engine optimization, pay per click management, social media marketing, and content marketing. In today's’ competitive landscape you most likely need a comprehensive marketing plan.

**Search Engine Optimization** is a process of addressing the factors that search engines look for their ranking signals. Usually involves on-page optimization like website structure and content formatting, off-page optimization like link building.

**Pay Per Click Management** includes creating and managing ads that will show up in the Ads section of the search results. A professional will select the best keywords for the account, use the correct match types, create a well-defined account structure, address the proper daily budgets, select reasonable keyword bids, define the geographic target areas and write compelling ads that will increase the click-through rate. Let’s not forget a high converting landing page is a key part of a successful search engine marketing strategy.
